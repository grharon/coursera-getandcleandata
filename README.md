This repository contains R code that downloads and does some preprocessing on Human
Activity Recognition data set. The full description and the data can be found
[here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the zip file as 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder
3. Dowload the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R))
4. Change the work directory accordingly

**Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).**

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy.txt](tidy.txt).**

See `CodeBook.md` for details.
